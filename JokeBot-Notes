Jokebot notes

Start Arduino from /opt/arduino-1.6.9 double click arduino

See /Documents/Javascript/Arduino Notes for further information about Javascript receiving messages from Arduino. Notes about
connectivity issues and having to reset port permissions before uploading.

Also note that rosserial loses connection with arduino from time to time.

Sometimes when starting rosserial you will get multiple failures before actually connecting
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1465777825.585768] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1465777840.586693] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino
etc.....

Seems that after page refresh you need to manually execute a voice command before the message from ROS will trigger a voice message.
